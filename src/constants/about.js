export const BIO_INFO = `Frontend developer. JavaScript fan. Likes computer science, sci-fi and lo-fi music.`

// export const ABOUT_ME = `My area of expertise is frontend development and everything related to the client-side. \n 
// My emphasis is frontend technologies and modern Javascript frameworks, and I’m passionate about building web-based UI, interaction and writing high quality codes. \n 
// During my early years of career, with backgrounds in Engineering and Psychology, I worked as a UX Designer at a consumer electronics company – BenQ. I was responsible to provide user-centric solutions for various award winning products. Working as a UX designer, I always respect highly on people who can bring great designs to life. And in 2015, I decided to go back to school and train to become a frontend developer. \n
//  During the day, I work with an amazing creative team and software engineers in an agile environment, translating design mockups into responsive layouts, tweening interactions and animations, building and managing the frontend of our various web applications. \n
//  And after hours, I fire up my code editor and start composing one of my many side projects. I enjoy working as a frontend developer and continue learning new techniques – <mark>JAMStack</mark>, <mark>devOps</mark>, etc. \n I also have experience with <mark>Node.js</mark>, <mark>Express</mark>, <mark>Firebase</mark> and <mark>Three.js</mark>.
